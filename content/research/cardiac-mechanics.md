The heart is the muscular organ responsible to pump blood in order to
supply the body with oxygen and nutrients. The heart consist of four
chambers, namely the left and right atria and the left and right
ventricles. 


## What is cardiac modeling?


When modeling the mechanics of the heart at an organ level
it is commen to only focus on the ventricles, and in particular the
left ventricle which is the chamber responsible to pump blood from the
heart to the body. In fact, since we do not allways know the shape of
the left ventricle we sometimes even assumes that the left ventricle
can be approximated by a simpler geometric object. The simplest
possible geometry we can think of is the sphere.
