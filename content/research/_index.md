On this page you will find posts about the research that I have
conducted throughout the years. During my master studies I focused
on harmonic and functional analysis and in particular to application
in signal processing. During my PhD I worked in patient-specific modeling of cardiac
mechanics, and currently I work with modeling of cellular
electrophysiology.

However my research interest span a whole range of
topics including image and signal processing, machine learning and
artificial intelligence, geometric modeling and visualization,
scientific computing, high performance computing, cloud computing.
