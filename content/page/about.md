My name is Henrik Finsberg and I work as a Research Engineer at the
department of Computational Physiology at Simula Research Laboratory
in Oslo, Norway.

I am married to Elisabeth and have two beautiful daughters called
Ingerid (4 years) and Eva (1 year).

I was born in Oslo on August 20th 1987, and grew up in a place called
BÃ¦rum west of Oslo. During my childhood I liked to listen to music,
play guitar and trained Taekwondo. I actually manage to get a black belt
in the end.

After high school, in 2006, I went to do my military service where I
took the Army officer school serving in the engineering battalion at
Skjold. The military service lasted for two years, the first year
being officer and basic military training while during the second year
I served as a squad leader in the Machine company.

Although I really liked the military, I quickly realised that I was
more of the academic type, and therefore I decided to start my studies
at the Norwegian university of science and technology. During my time
in the military I had gained an interest in construction engineering
which is why I started at the master program civil- and environmental
engineering.

However, after two years into the program I realised that
both my heart and skillset were geared towards mathematics, and therefore
I switch to the Physics and Mathematics program and later specialised in
industrial mathematics. After studying industrial mathematics for one year I started at the Nordic Master program in Applied and engineering mathematics(N5TeAM). Here I went together with my wife to study at the Technical University in Denmark (DTU) for the first year, and then back to NTNU for the final year.

During my time at DTU I had a great professor in Functional Analysis which really inspired my to dig deeper into this field, and in particular to Wavelet theory. Therefore I took some extra courses in Fourier and Complex analysis and started to specialise in harmonic analysis.

During the writing of my master thesis, I decided to make a transition from theoretical to applied harmonic analysis. And therefore I wrote about image classification of ultrasound images using a convolutional neural network where the building blocks were wavelets.

Short time after finishing my master degree, I applied for a PhD position at Simula Research Laboratory in Oslo within the Cardiac Modelig group. At January 17th 2018 I defended my thesis entitled *Patient-specific computational modeling of cardiac mechanics*.

Currently, I work as a research engineer in the computational physiology group at Simula Research Laboratory, where my current project is concerned with modeling of stem cells.
