### Personal summary

> In October 2017 I started as a Research Engineer at Simula Research Laboratory in the department for Scientific Computing, and will work with development of computational modeling tools primarily with application in electrophysiology. 

> Before I started as a Research Engineer I was a PhD student in the Cardiac Modelling group in the department for Scientific Computing, also at Simula Research Laboratory. In my PhD I worked with patient specific models of the cardiac mechanics, and defended it at January 17th 2018.

> I graduated in 2014 after finishing a joint master degree in Applied and Engineering Mathematics at NTNU in Trondheim and DTU in Copenhagen. My fields of interests are mathematical modelling, geometric modelling and image processing. In my master thesis I studied methods for image classification of ultrasound images based on convolutional neural networks.
