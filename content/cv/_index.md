### Personal summary

> From May 2019 to May 2020 I will also be a part time visiting
researcher at the [Healey Lab](http://coebiomaterial.wpengine.com) 
working with computational tools for "heart-on-chip" systems.

> In October 2017 I started as a Research Engineer at Simula Research
Laboratory in the department for Scientific Computing, and will work
with development of computational modeling tools primarily with application
in electrophysiology.

> Before I started as a Research Engineer I was a PhD student in the Cardiac
Modelling group in the department for Scientific Computing, also at Simula
Research Laboratory. In my PhD I worked with patient specific models of
the cardiac mechanics, and defended it at January 17th 2018.

> I graduated in 2014 after finishing a joint master degree in Applied and
Engineering Mathematics at NTNU in Trondheim and DTU in Copenhagen. My fields
of interests are mathematical modelling, geometric modelling and image
processing. In my master thesis I studied methods for image classification
of ultrasound images based on convolutional neural networks.
