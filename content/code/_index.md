During my time as a PhD student and a reasearch engineer at Simula, I
have been written a lot of code. My preferred language is with no
doubt [python](https://www.python.org), a language which I had almost
never used before I started my PhD.

Here you will find posts about the software and toolboxes that I have
written as well as post about useful tips and tricks that I have
encountered. Please check out my repositories at
[Github](https://github.com/finsberg) and
[Bitbucket](https://github.com/finsberg) for a full list of all my
public coding projects.
